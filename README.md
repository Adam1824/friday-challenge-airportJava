## Learning a new language
### My process
Find a program with **basic functionality** of that language, something **procedural** or basic **OPP**.
Start off by **reading through the program** to see if you **understand the general idea**, **not** all the syntax.
**Make the program yourself**, whilst looking at the original, but **don't copy paste** anything
Try and **make the program without the original** and googling when really stuck.
You can also **watch YouTube videos** and **google tutorials** to get a better understanding.
**PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE**
